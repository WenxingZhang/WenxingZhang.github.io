Alternating structure-adapted proximal (ASAP) gradient algorithm (M. Nikolova and P. Tan, SIAM J Optim, 29:2053-2078) has drawn much attention due to its efficiency in solving nonconvex nonsmooth optimization. However, the multiblock nonseparable structure confines the applications of ASAP to far-reaching practical problems, e.g., coupled tensor decomposition. In this paper, we propose an extended ASAP (eASAP) algorithm for nonconvex nonsmooth optimization whose objective is the sum of two nonseparable functions and a coupling one. By exploiting the blockwise restricted prox-regularity property, eASAP is capable of  minimizing the objective whose coupling function is multiblock nonseparable. 
Moreover, we analyze the  global convergence of eASAP by virtue of the Aubin property on partial subdifferential mapping and the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property on the objective. Furthermore, the sublinear convergence rate of eASAP is built upon the proximal point algorithmic framework under some mild conditions. 
Numerical simulations on multimodal data fusion demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed method.
